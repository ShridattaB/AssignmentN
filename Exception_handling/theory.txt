Try Block:

"The try block is where I put the code that might cause an error."
Except Block:

"The except block is like a backup plan. If something goes wrong in the try block, the code inside except is there to fix the problem or handle it gracefully."
Else Block:

"The else block is for things that should happen only if everything in the try block goes smoothly. It's like a reward for no errors."
Finally Block:

"The finally block is like a safety net. It always runs, no matter what happens in the try block. Good for cleanup or making sure something important gets done."



The try block is where you put code that might have an issue,
and Python attempts to run it, but if something goes wrong, the except block deals with it.






***in try block we put that code which might give error
to del with this error we ttake help of except block 
else is used if try block run smoothly without giving any error
finally block excute if error occer or not which indicates the excution of program is done***


Describe the role of the except block in handling exceptions.
 Can it handle multiple types of exceptions? If so, how?

**Role of except block is to handle to error which occurs in try block 
yes exception block multiple type of  exception
example like value error type error ,index error**

Discuss the significance of the finally block and when
 it is executed in relation to the try and except blocks.

**finally block occers when excution of code is done no matter 
what happens in the preceding try and except blocks.
no any relation to try and else block
it commonly use for closing the given progrm or file**

How can you obtain information about the exception that occurred within 
the except block?
**by using as keyword we obtaion information
except error as a
print(a)**
